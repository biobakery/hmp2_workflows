            Samples are diluted and run in a 30 cycle PCR that specifically
            amplifies the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal subunit, with the
            primers making use of the highly conserved regions on either
            side. PCR primers are barcoded by well, in a dual plate format,
            for a total of 192 available barcodes. Samples are quantified
            using the caliper, and then pooled together. Finally, the pooled
            sample is cleaned up and selected for size by using a combination
            of purification columns and a Pippen Prep SAGE protocol, and
            handed off for MiSeq.

            Metagenomic DNA samples were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
            Assay (Life Technologies) and normalized to a concentration of
            50 pg/microliter. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from
            100-250 pg DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation
            kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's recommended
            protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Batches of
            24, 48, or 96 libraries were pooled by transferring equal
            volumes of each library using a Labcyte Echo 550 liquid
            handler. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled
            library were determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000
            kit (Agilent Technologies).

            Our method, RNAtag-Seq, utilizes a molecular barcoding strategy
            that generates multiple libraries in a single reaction, lowers
            labor and reagent costs per sample, and produces data on
            prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples that are comparable to
            those generated by traditional strand-specific RNA-seq
            approaches.  Barcoding in RNAtag-Seq is achieved through
            direct ligation of adaptors to RNA, enabling high quality,
            strand-specific, quantitative sequencing of full-length
            transcripts in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic species.
