      Samples are diluted and run in a 30 cycle PCR that specifically
      amplifies the V4 region of the 16S ribosomal subunit, with the
      primers making use of the highly conserved regions on either
      side. PCR primers are barcoded by well, in a dual plate format,
      for a total of 192 available barcodes. Samples are quantified
      using the caliper, and then pooled together. Finally, the pooled
      sample is cleaned up and selected for size by using a combination
      of purification columns and a Pippen Prep SAGE protocol, and
      handed off for MiSeq.

        Metagenomic DNA samples were quantified by Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA
        Assay (Life Technologies) and normalized to a concentration of
        50 pg/microliter. Illumina sequencing libraries were prepared from
        100-250 pg DNA using the Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation
        kit (Illumina) according to the manufacturer's recommended
        protocol, with reaction volumes scaled accordingly. Batches of
        24, 48, or 96 libraries were pooled by transferring equal
        volumes of each library using a Labcyte Echo 550 liquid
        handler. Insert sizes and concentrations for each pooled

        Our method, RNAtag-Seq, utilizes a molecular barcoding strategy
        that generates multiple libraries in a single reaction, lowers
        labor and reagent costs per sample, and produces data on
        prokaryotic and eukaryotic samples that are comparable to
        those generated by traditional strand-specific RNA-seq
        approaches.  Barcoding in RNAtag-Seq is achieved through
        direct ligation of adaptors to RNA, enabling high quality,
        strand-specific, quantitative sequencing of full-length
        transcripts in diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic species.
